# Malaysia API üá≤üáæ

A REST API about states in Malaysia.

All information are obtained from Wikipedia.

If you have noticed some mistakes or bugs, or maybe you have any suggestions please create an issue.

This API is meant to be a read-only web API. It is **intentional** for files to be stored this way (json format) as it avoids using any database engine.

# Introduction

The states and federal territories of Malaysia are the principal administrative divisions of Malaysia. Malaysia is a federation of 13 states (Negeri) and 3 federal territories (Wilayah Persekutuan).

11 states and 2 federal territories are located on the Malay Peninsula, collectively called Peninsular Malaysia (Semenanjung Malaysia) or West Malaysia. 2 states are on the island of Borneo, and the remaining federal territory consists of islands offshore of Borneo; they are collectively referred to as East Malaysia or Malaysian Borneo. Out of the 13 states in Malaysia, 9 are monarchies.

The aim of this API is to provide static information that will be consumed by other applications.
